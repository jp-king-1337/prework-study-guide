# <Your-Project-Title>

## Description

I want to begin a new, higher-paying career, so I enrolled in the Rutgers Coding Bootcamp. As part of the prework for the class, I built this study guide while working through the prework lessons. With this site, I gained an appreciation for the back-end work that goes into building a website, while also making a place for me notes to live.

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

This study guide can be referenced for key terms. Each section contains notes on a particular topic, and if you open the DevTools console you can see the JavaScript. It will suggest a topic from prework for you to sudy first.


## Credits

## License

Please refer to the LICENSE in the repo.

üèÜ The previous sections are the bare minimum, and your project will ultimately determine the content of this document. You might also want to consider adding the following sections.

## Badges

![MIT License](https://img.shields.io/bower/l/JP)

Badges aren't necessary, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Looking for your own badge? Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here. Mine does not, but yours might.

## How to Contribute

I did not create an application or package, but maybe you did. If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute to it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here. Or don't. I didn't, because there isn't much to test here.
